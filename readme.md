##The Highline Trail
**By Hannah Wright**
<p> This project is a depiction of the route of the Highline Trail in Glacier National Park. The trail is approximately 11.4 miles long and is one of the most popular hikes in Glacier. It follows along the "Garden Wall" which is a part of the continental divide, and approximately one-quarter of a mile from the trailhead you will encounter the famous ledge, hanging like a shelf along the Garden Wall. It is only six to eight feet in width, and has drop-offs of roughly one hundred feet or more down to the road below. At 3.6 miles hikers will reach Haystack Pass, which is a popular spot to take a break while admiring the views. The remaining miles lead to the Granite Park Chalet, which was built in 1914 and 1915 by the Great Northern Railway in order to provide comfortable backcountry accommodations inside Glacier National Park. I hiked this trail in around 2016 and it is one of the most memorable hikes I've ever done.</p>
<p> The major functions of this map include being able to hover over placemarkers to see the trail beginning, end, and two popular stops along the way, being able to zoom in and out along the route, and having a brief description with links to pages with more information about the trail. </p>
